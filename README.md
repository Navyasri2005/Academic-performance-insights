# Student Result Analysis

## Project Overview
The Student Result Analysis project uses a Jupyter Notebook to explore, clean, and analyze student academic performance data. It identifies trends, correlations, and factors affecting student outcomes, providing actionable insights for teachers, schools, and policymakers.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies  
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) of marks, grades, attendance, and demographics  
- Statistical insights such as averages, medians, and performance distributions  
- Correlation analysis between key features (for example, attendance vs. grades)  
- Optional predictive modeling to forecast student outcomes  

## Dataset
The dataset typically includes:
- Student IDs  
- Subject-wise scores  
- Attendance percentage  
- Demographic information (if available)  
- Pass/Fail or Grade categories  

*(Adjust according to your actual dataset.)*

## Folder Structure

## Technology Stack

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Key Insights (Example)

* Students with higher attendance tend to achieve better grades
* Certain subjects show strong correlations between midterm and final scores
* Gender or region-based trends may emerge depending on the dataset

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/student-result-analysis.git
cd student-result-analysis
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Open the notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook "Student Result Analysis.ipynb"
```

## Future Improvements

* Add machine learning models to predict student outcomes
* Create an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Power BI
* Incorporate additional datasets for richer insights

Student Result Analysis provides a clear approach to turning raw academic data into meaningful insights.
